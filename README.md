# Browser Calculator

## Overview

Browser calculator that emulates the MacOS default calculator app. It was built for a [The Odin Project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator), course that I have been taking to develop my web development skills, to consolidate the knowledge acquired on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

The calculator performs all of the basic math operators, such as add, multiply, subtract, and divide, while showing the numbers selected and the result in the calculator display, and stringing together several operations. It also allows the introduction of floating point numbers, includes a backspace button, and a function to toggle between light and dark mode. 

## Running the project

Because this is a web based calculator, you can simply run it visiting the corresponding Github page: [https://jdomil.github.io/calculator/](https://jdomil.github.io/calculator/)
